This blog post checks for `changeme` in *categories* and *tags*.

My *arechetype* template has `changeme` in both fields, as a reminder to add *categories* and *tags*.
Obviously these should be removed before publishing a post.

For the off-chance that this *category* or *tag* should be in the posting, the warning can be silenced.

In this test, both warnings are silenced.
