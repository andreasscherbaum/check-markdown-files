This blog post checks if every code block has a syntax highlighting specified.
Along the way it also checks if there's an equal number of opening and closing tags.

More information about the syntax highlighting types is [available here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).

```natural
A code block with natural highlighting
```

```
A code block without highlighting
```
